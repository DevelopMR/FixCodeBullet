Exploding Code Bullet's Flappy Bird Christmas Gift

First attempt at artificial intelligence.  

I first fixed Code Bullet's Flappy Bird Christmas Gift.  The Pipe Pairs were not syhnchronizing their pipes, causing general craziness.
Also, Code Bullet seemed to want to vary the First and second Pipe Pairs which led to quick deaths, so that got massaged to a better level.

I left some of the pair overrides in place because by then I wanted to add more behavior to the birds, which is to add a left/right ability to perhaps improve their swoops and overcome the double pair problem.

The entire frame was expanded and the birds were given more freedom to roam horizontally.

New Vision was added for the brain:
- xPos

New Responses added (at this time I think these are named backwards, but compters don't read...yet)
- left
- right

By the the 7-8th generations these little squirts actually figure it out! 
THANK YOU CODE BULLET
